# PrimitiveArray

[*generalized Algebraic Dynamic Programming Homepage*](http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/Software/gADP/)

PrimitiveArray provides operations on multi-dimensional arrays. Internally, the
representation is based on the vector library, while the multi-dimensional
indexing follows repa.

Primitive arrays are designed to be used together with ADPfusion.
